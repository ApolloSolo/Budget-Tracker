## Description
In this project, I utilized existing code to implement Progressive Web Application (PWA) technologies. The service-worker allows users to use the app even durned poor or no cellular network connection. In the absence of a connection, IndexedDB will store post request data and deliver that data to Mongo once service has been restored. The use of manifest.json allows the app to be save and ran as if it were a native application. 
  
## Technologies

JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, IndexedDB, Service-Worker
